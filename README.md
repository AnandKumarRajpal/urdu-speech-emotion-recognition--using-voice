Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) can be defined as the task of recognizing or extracting the emotional state of the speaker from the speech signal, irrespective of the semantic contents. It can be viewed as a classification problem in which you discriminate between different emotions. This is done by extracting different speech information which identifies specific types of tones and pitches in the voice of a speaker which is then mapped to a state of emotion respectively. Building a model to detect emotions from speech is a challenging task due to different limitations in datasets, feature extraction, and classifiers. There have been various attempts at building SER models in the English language, but few attempts have been done in building an Urdu speech emotion recognition model. Therefore, the aim of our project is to build a speech emotion recognition model that can detect emotions from Urdu speech and audio files.
